# Project Background
Uber is a global ride-hailing platform that connects customers with drivers through its app. Since its launch in 2009, Uber has revolutionized urban transportation by providing on-demand rides, transparent pricing, and cashless payments

this project focuses on exploring 1.5 lakh booking records to understand operational efficiency and customer behavior. The analysis dives into key performance areas such as:


Overall Booking Performance Metrics – Understanding the ratio of successful vs failed rides, along with a detailed breakdown of customer cancellations, driver cancellations, and incomplete rides.

Performance by Vehicle Type – Evaluating demand, cancellations, breakdowns, and booking value across different vehicle categories.

Financial Analysis – Estimating revenue earned, potential revenue lost due to cancellations or incomplete rides, and average revenue per ride.

Ride Distribution by Time & Location – Identifying peak booking hours, popular pickup hubs, and demand concentration.

Operational Growth & Retention – Measuring month-over-month growth (CMGR), retention rate of customers, and long-term usage trends.

Customer Experience & Satisfaction – Analyzing customer and driver ratings to assess service quality
