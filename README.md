# Uber Data Analysis using EDA

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an Uber ride booking dataset. The objective was to analyze booking patterns, identify success and failure trends, and uncover the major reasons behind booking cancellations.

Project Overview

The analysis focuses on understanding booking behavior, customer and driver cancellations, and overall operational efficiency. The goal was to provide data-driven insights that can help improve service reliability.

Key Findings

- Total bookings analyzed: 150,000  
- Successful bookings: 103,500 (69%)  
- Failed bookings: 46,500 (31%)  
- Among failed bookings, driver cancellations were the highest contributor, followed by customer cancellations and incomplete bookings  
- Majority of booking failures stem from operational inefficiencies on the driver side  

Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook  

Key Takeaways

Analyzing booking success and failure patterns provides valuable insights into customer experience and operational efficiency. Understanding the distribution of cancellations can help businesses optimize driver allocation, reduce failed bookings, and improve customer satisfaction.

Future Scope

- Build predictive models to estimate the likelihood of cancellations  
- Perform time-series analysis of bookings across different time periods  
- Develop interactive dashboards using Plotly or Streamlit for business reporting
